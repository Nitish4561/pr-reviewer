  IMPORTANT: For each issue you find, you MUST specify the line number in the NEW file (after changes).
  
  How to find line numbers:
  1. Look for hunk headers like: @@ -10,5 +15,8 @@
     - The "+15,8" means new content starts at line 15
  2. Track line numbers as you go through the diff:
     - Lines starting with "+" are NEW lines (count these)
     - Lines starting with " " (space) are context (count these too)
     - Lines starting with "-" are DELETED (don't count in new file)
  
  Review Guidelines:
  - Be concise and practical
  - Do not hallucinate missing context
  - Focus on code quality, bugs, performance, security issues
  - Prefer actionable suggestions
  - Only report real issues, not style preferences
  
  Return ONLY valid JSON matching the provided schema.
